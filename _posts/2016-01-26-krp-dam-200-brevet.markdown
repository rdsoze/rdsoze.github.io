This was my 2nd attempt at a 200km brevet this year. The first was a failed Anchetty attempt in the second week of Jan.
The route would take us through Hosur, Rayakottai, KRP dam, Krishnagiri and back to Bangalore.
Vamsi and Rushit, my Manali-Leh buddies, had also signed up for this brevet along with 45 other folks. Vamsi and I stay in Koramangala and we decided to ride together to the start point.

Me: Let's leave at 4:45 tomorrow morning from your place.<br>
Vamsi: Crazy!? The reporting time is 4:30 am.<br>
Me: But start time is 5:30 am.<br>
Vamsi: No, let's leave at 4:00 am.<br>
Me: No, how about 4:30.<br>
Vamsi: 4:15 last. Remember that I am on my MTB.<br>
Me: 4:25<br>
Vamsi: Ok I propose we leave at 4:20 but from Forum.<br>
Me: Uggh! Ok.<br>

Next morning, I messaged Vamsi at 4:15 that I was going to leave in 10 minutes. Every extra minute of sleep counts!

We meet Rushit, Sir Rushit. He happens to be a Super Randonneur(SR)(link) and a Paris-Brest-Paris(PBP) finisher. Every one knew him.
There are two kinds of people at a Brevet start point. Ones who have done it before, and those who haven't. The ice breaking session with both groups goes the same.
Have you done this before ?
What is your time target ?
In Rushit's case, everyone was eager to know if he would attempt for an SR this year too. The expectations were already set for him by everyone else before the brevet even began. We managed to get a selfie with the celebrity :D

Below is the elevation profile.

At Hosur, I met Shuvishek, a seasoned rider. We had breakfast just after the 1st control point at 45kms. 2 plates of 3 idlies each and a dosa cost us just Rs. 30!
A couple of hours later the sun was at full blast. With minimal usage of the cue sheet, I was able to get to the halfway control point at 10:30 am, having started 5 hours earlier.

I was adviced to have lunch at Shoolagiri. Reaching there was painfully slow and tiring. Faced with the full brunt of the sun, I took cover besides trailers every few kilometres. Phone switches off, DAMN YOU ANDROID BATTERY. Couple of hours later, I step inside the McDonalds at Shoolagiri, grab three McAloos and rest for half an hour.

Why am I doing this? What do I have to prove? These thoughts were stirring up my head the last 40 kms. I reached the endpoint and successfully completed this brevet in a timing of 11 hours. There was no euphoric high, only pain. An hour later, Vamsi joined me at the finish line with similar thoughts.
